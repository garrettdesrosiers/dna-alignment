# dna-alignment

A python project created for an Algorithms assignment that can be used to find the optimal alignment of sequences of DNA.

Two sequences are given as input, as well as a scoring matrix (for when there are two ideal matches for certain characters, but one is more ideal than another)

Sample input and output files are given to illustrate this. This program uses dynamic programming to find the optimal alignment.
